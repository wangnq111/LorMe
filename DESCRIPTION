Description: Provides a robust collection of functions tailored for microbial ecology analysis, encompassing both data analysis and visualization. It introduces an encapsulation feature that streamlines the process into a summary object. With the initial configuration of this summary object, users can execute a wide range of analyses with a single line of code, requiring only two essential parameters for setup. The package delivers comprehensive outputs including analysis objects, statistical outcomes, and visualization-ready data, enhancing the efficiency of research workflows. Designed with user-friendliness in mind, it caters to both novices and seasoned researchers, offering an intuitive interface coupled with adaptable customization options to meet diverse analytical needs.
